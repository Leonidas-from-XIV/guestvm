/**
 * GuestVM implementation of the VMThreadFactory.
 * Although we don't know the exact subclass that will be created, we build
 * a cache of instances at image build time for runtime use by newVmThread.
 * This is to ensure that all VmThread instances are in the boot heap
 * and therefore avoid issues with entry to the scheduler while GC is taking place.
 * N.B. Even if the GC threads are non pre-emptable entry to the scheduler
 * can still occur due to an external event which typically requires touching
 * a VmThread instance.
