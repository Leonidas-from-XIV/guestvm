/**
 * A test for whether spin locks prevent pre-emptive scheduling.
 * The Looper thread is started and waits for the Spinner, then loops asserting that the spinner is not running.
 * The Spinner grabs the spin lock and loops for the given running time and then releases the lock.
 * If the Spinner is pre-empted, the Looper will run and output a message to that effect.
 *
 * N.B. You must run this test with VCPUS == 1!
 *
 * The P variety of spinlocks, e.g., com.sun.guestvm.spinlock.tas.p.PTTASSpinLock
 * should produce the message All others should not.
