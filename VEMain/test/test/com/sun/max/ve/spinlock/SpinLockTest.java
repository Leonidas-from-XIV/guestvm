 * Simple test to measure spinlock performance.
 * A set of threads contend for a shared spinlock.
 * The work is represented by incrementing a per-thread counter
 * a variable number of times while the lock is held.

 * Args: [t nt] [r nr] [f nf] [k klass]
 *
 * t: number of threads
 * r: runtime in seconds
 * f: number of times counter is incremented while lock is held
 * k: spin lock class to instantiate (omitting com.sun.max.ve.spinlock prefix)
