/**
 * Basic run queue support for scheduler (but implementation independent for testing).
 * Used by the Java scheduler to organize the runnable threads.
 * The choice of data structure is left to the concrete subclass
 * Access to the queue must be protected by the spin lock associated with the queue.
 * Methods with name lockedXXX acquire and release the lock internally, otherwise
 * it is the callers responsibility to ensure the lock is held (useful for multiple operations).
 *
 * Run queues are typically allocated during image build in the Maxine boot heap,
 * but may require additional initialization at run-time (e.g. native spin lock creation).
 *
 * Therefore, separate initialization methods are provided for use at image build time
 * and runtime.
