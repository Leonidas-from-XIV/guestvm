/**
 * Provides a way to map from VirtualFileSystem instances to small integers. This is because
 * the upper layers, e.g. FileInputStream traffic in file descriptors, aka small integers, and there
 * needs to be a way to get from file descriptors to the corresponding VirtualFileSystem instance.
 * This avoids having to ensure that file descriptors returned by VirtualFileSystem instances are
 * globally unique, since this can be achieved by merging a file descriptor and a VirtualFileSystem
 * instance id.
 *
 * The file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are predefined globally; therefore the first entry in the table
 * must be the file system that supports these standard descriptors.
