/**
 * Pointcuts to trace almost everything in the network stack.
 * 
 * Note that the GUKNetDevice.copyPacket method must NOT be traced as it is not allowed to make any external calls.
 * Note also that the GUKNetDevice.DeviceHandler class cannot be traced as it uses hidden access methods which are
 * themselves traced (don't know how to prevent this) and some of these execute with interrupts disabled, which precludes any
 * entry to the scheduler (which will happen if the trace system is called).
