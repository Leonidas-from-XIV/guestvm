GuestVM Native (C) Shim for Maxine on Xen
=========================================

This is the native (C) code that connects the Maxine VM to the Guest VM Microkernel (GUK)
to construct a guest image that can be run on the Xen hypervisor. 

Building
========

This code is generally built from Eclipse/Netbeans using the Guest VM image generator.
However, when working solely on the native code, gmake can be used to recompile the 
C code and relink the Guest VM image.

Three environment variables must be set up:

XEN_ROOT    the root of your Xen distribution
GUK_ROOT    the root of the Guest VM Microkernel
JAVA_HOME   the root of your Java installation

The just type gmake.

Running
=======

Please refer to the documentation on Guest VM.

License
=======

This code is licensed under GPL V2.

More Info
=========

More documentation can be found in the "docs" directory.
