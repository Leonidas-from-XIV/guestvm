/*
 * Maxine assumes that native symbols are resolved by the dlsym function, which is normally
 * part of the dynamic library mechanism on traditional operating systems. dlsym is typically
 * called once per native symbol resolution and subsequently cached in the VM, so performance
 * of the lookup is not an issue.
 *
 * Maxine VE has a very simple dlsym implementation that simply assumes that the native
 * symbol is defined somewhere in the image. So for a "char *symbol" argument it
 * simply returns symbol. This requires a definition for the symbol at compile time and
 * an actual implementation at run time.
 *
 * Rather than have one large lookup table, the implementation of dlsym is distributed
 * among the several files. In particular Maxine VE native code that defines such functions
 * always includes a subsystem dlsym function named "subsystem_dlsym".
